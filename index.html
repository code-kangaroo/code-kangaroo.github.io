            <div class="one-column">
                <p>
                    Welcome to my website! My name is Paul, I live in Aachen (Germany) and I am currently pursuing a
                    Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science at RWTH Aachen University. I created
                    CodeKangaroo to be able to earn some money on the side whenever I code something for someone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of my course at university, I have learned how to write advanced C++ code, and have come to
                    appreciate C++ for its performance and structure. However, I have also programmed in Python or using
                    MATLAB. For my degree I am attending or have attended lectures such as "Introduction to
                    High-Performance Computing", "Software Engineering", "Machine Learning" and "Computer Vision", which
                    help to improve my skills for this type of work. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for the
                    subject "Introduction to Programming", which teaches C++ to beginners, and gets into all the nitty
                    gritty details about pointers, templates and the like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my choice of subjects and my current work as research assistant for the Institute for
                    Automotive Engineering (<a href="www.ika.rwth-aachen.de">ika</a>) I am starting to specialise in
                    autonomous driving, which is a subject I
                    am highly interested in.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="secondary-heading">EXPERIENCE</h4>
            <div class="one-column">
                <p>
                    Because of my exchange year in Australia during my high school time, I was able to find a software
                    engineering internship back in Australia after I had finished my high school degree. In three months
                    of full-time programming I learned a lot about what it means to work in a team, how to adapt to
                    existing work environments and how to come up with creative ways to add new functionality to
                    software. As one of the only software developers in a company mainly focused on civil engineering, I
                    had a lot of responsibility and creative freedom to develop some new solutions and small software
                    tools for my coworkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at university I worked for the Chair for Computational Analysis of Technical Systems
                    (CATS), for which I mostly maintained and improved some legacy FEM solver, written in FORTRAN. I was
                    able to make a lot of improvements and refactor a lot of code, which in some cases was written long
                    before I was even born. I gained experience in a collaborative coding environment, and was once
                    again able to leave the code base in a much better state than I found it in.
